# Phase 3: Procedural Development Framework

## Overview

This document establishes the procedural development framework for completing the Alan Hirsch Ministry Platform. The framework ensures each feature is fully complete, tested, and documented before moving to the next feature.

## Core Principles

### 1. **One Feature at a Time**

- Complete each feature fully before starting the next
- No parallel development of multiple features
- Clear feature boundaries and completion criteria

### 2. **Test-Driven Development**

- Write tests before implementing features
- Ensure each feature passes all tests
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### 3. **Integration-First Approach**

- Build backend integration before UI
- Ensure API contracts are stable before frontend work
- Test integration points thoroughly

### 4. **Documentation-Driven**

- Document each completed feature
- Update API documentation in real-time
- Maintain user guides and technical docs
