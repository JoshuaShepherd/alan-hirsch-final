## Success Criteria

### Assessment Interface Completion
- [ ] Users can browse and select assessments
- [ ] Users can take assessments with progress tracking
- [ ] Users can view detailed results and recommendations
- [ ] All assessment flows are tested and documented

### Community Features Completion
- [ ] Users can share content with the community
- [ ] Users can network and collaborate
- [ ] Real-time features work properly
- [ ] Community content is properly moderated

### Search and Filtering Completion
- [ ] Global search returns relevant results
- [ ] Advanced filtering works across all content types
- [ ] Search performance is optimized
- [ ] Search analytics provide insights

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Feature Dependencies**: Assessment interface must be complete before community features
- **Data Migration**: Existing data may need migration as features are added
- **Performance**: Search functionality may impact database performance

### Medium Risk
- **User Experience**: Complex features may confuse users
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration between features increases testing complexity
- **Documentation**: Keeping documentation updated as features are added

### Low Risk
- **API Stability**: Core API endpoints are stable and well-tested
- **Infrastructure**: Database and authentication systems are solid
- **Component Library**: UI components are reusable and consistent

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Complete assessment selection interface
2. **Short-term**: Implement assessment taking flow
3. **Medium-term**: Build results display system
4. **Long-term**: Integrate community features and search

This procedural approach ensures each feature is fully complete and tested before moving to the next, reducing complexity and improving maintainability.
