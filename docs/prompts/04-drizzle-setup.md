# Phase 2: Database Optimization - Part 1 (COMPLETED ✅)

## Step 2.1: Optimize Existing Drizzle ORM Setup for Production

**Completion Status**: ✅ 100% Complete
**Context Files Needed**:

- `/lib/db/schema/index.ts` - Complete database schema
- `/drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle configuration
- `/lib/db/connection.ts` - Database connection setup
- `/supabase/migrations/` - Migration files
- `/docs/MASTER/DATABASE_CONNECTION_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Database docs

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Optimize our existing Drizzle ORM setup for production performance:

1. **Database Performance Analysis (COMPLETED):**
   - ✅ 12 tables implemented with proper relationships
   - ✅ Drizzle ORM configured with Supabase
   - ✅ Migration system working
   - ✅ Type-safe database operations

2. **Query Performance Optimization (NEEDS REVIEW):**
   - Analyze top 10 queries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
