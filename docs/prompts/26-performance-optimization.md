# Phase 9: Production Readiness - Part 1 (Days 30-31)

## Step 9.1: Performance Optimization

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Optimize our enhanced Next.js + Safety Training app for production performance:

1. Implement code splitting and lazy loading
2. Optimize database queries and indexing
3. Add caching strategies
4. Optimize bundle size
5. **Observability & error boundaries**:
   - **Hook API errors to logger (Sentry/OTel) with requestId correlation**
   - **Add React error boundaries for data-heavy pages**

Ensure the application loads quickly and performs well under load.
```

**Expected Output:**

- Code splitting and lazy loading implemented
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Caching strategies for performance
- Observability and error boundaries

**Definition of Done:**

- ✅ Performance optimized for production
- ✅ Bundle size optimized
- ✅ Observability and error boundaries implemented
