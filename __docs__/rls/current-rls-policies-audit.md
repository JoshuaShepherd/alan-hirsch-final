## Security Architecture

### Access Control Patterns

1. **User Ownership Model**
   - Users have full access to their own data
   - Privacy settings respected for profile visibility
   - Self-service capabilities for memberships and assessments

2. **Organization-Based Access**
   - Organization members can view organization data
   - Account owners can manage organization settings
   - Membership-based access control

3. **Public Content Model**
   - Published content is publicly accessible
   - Categories and subscription plans are public
   - Community discovery through public visibility

4. **Assessment Privacy**
   - Assessment results are private to users
   - Questions and assessments are publicly accessible
   - Self-service assessment participation

### Security Principles Implemented

✅ **Principle of Least Privilege** - Users only access what they need
✅ **Data Ownership** - Users control their own data
✅ **Privacy by Design** - Privacy settings respected throughout
✅ **Public Content Strategy** - Appropriate content is publicly accessible
✅ **Organization Boundaries** - Data isolation between organizations
✅ **Authentication Required** - Sensitive operations require authentication

### Future Implementation

When deploying additional tables, ensure:

1. **RLS Enablement** - Enable RLS on all new tables
2. **Policy Implementation** - Create appropriate policies following established patterns
3. **Helper Functions** - Create helper functions for complex access control
4. **Testing** - Implement comprehensive RLS testing
5. **Documentation** - Update this audit with new policies

### Policy Patterns to Follow

1. **User Ownership** - Users have full access to their own data
2. **Organization Membership** - Organization-based access control
3. **Public Content** - Appropriate content is publicly accessible
