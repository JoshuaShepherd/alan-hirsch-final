## Security Architecture

### Access Control Patterns Implemented

1. **User Ownership Pattern**
   - Users have full control over their own data
   - Privacy settings are respected
   - No cross-user data access

2. **Organization-Based Access Pattern**
   - Organization members can access organization data
   - Strong data isolation between organizations
   - Admin/owner roles for management

3. **Public Content Pattern**
   - Published content is publicly accessible
   - Authors maintain control over their content
   - Visibility rules are enforced

4. **Privacy-Respecting Pattern**
   - User privacy settings are enforced
   - Sensitive data is protected by default
   - Explicit consent for data sharing

5. **Authentication-Based Pattern**
   - Sensitive operations require authentication
   - Anonymous users have limited access
   - User-specific data requires proper authentication

### Security Principles Enforced

- ✅ **Principle of Least Privilege** - Users only access what they need
- ✅ **Data Ownership** - Users control their own data
- ✅ **Privacy by Design** - Privacy settings respected throughout
- ✅ **Public Content Strategy** - Appropriate content is publicly accessible
- ✅ **Organization Boundaries** - Data isolation between organizations
- ✅ **Authentication Required** - Sensitive operations require authentication

## Production Readiness

- ✅ **Query Optimization** - Efficient RLS policies
- ✅ **Index Usage** - Proper indexing for policy conditions
- ✅ **Caching Strategy** - Appropriate caching for public content

### ✅ Testing Coverage
