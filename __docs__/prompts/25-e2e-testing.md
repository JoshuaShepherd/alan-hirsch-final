# Phase 8: E2E Testing Infrastructure - Part 3 (IN PROGRESS ⚠️)

## Step 8.3: Fix E2E Testing Infrastructure

**Completion Status**: ⚠️ 80% Complete (Infrastructure ready, server config issue)
**Context Files Needed**:

- `/tests/e2e/` - E2E test files
- `/playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `/__tests__/e2e/` - E2E test infrastructure
- `/scripts/phase6-e2e-test-runner.ts` - E2E test runner
- `/docs/TESTING_STATUS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Testing status

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Fix our E2E testing infrastructure and complete test coverage for the Alan Hirsch Digital Platform:

1. **Server Configuration Fix (PRIORITY 1):**
   - Identify and fix server 500 error blocking E2E tests
   - Resolve authentication issues in test environment
   - Fix database connection problems in test setup
   - Validate environment configuration for testing

2. **E2E Test Implementation (INFRASTRUCTURE READY):**
   - Complete user registration journey tests
   - Implement assessment taking flow tests
   - Add content management workflow tests
   - Create community feature tests
   - Build organization management tests

3. **Test Data Management (NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION):**
   - Set up test data factories for assessments, content, users
   - Implement test database seeding and cleanup
   - Add test environment isolation
   - Create test user and organization fixtures

4. **CI/CD Testing Pipeline (NEEDS REVIEW):**
   - Fix Playwright test execution in CI
   - Set up test reporting and artifacts
   - Configure test environment variables
   - Implement test result notifications

**Current Status**: E2E infrastructure ready, server configuration issue blocking execution. Fix server issue first.
```

**Expected Output:**

- ✅ Server configuration issue fixed
- ✅ E2E tests running successfully
- ✅ Test data management implemented
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline working
- ✅ Complete test coverage for critical workflows

**Definition of Done:**

- ✅ E2E testing infrastructure working
- ✅ Server configuration issues resolved
- ✅ Test data management functional
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline configured
- ✅ All critical user workflows tested
