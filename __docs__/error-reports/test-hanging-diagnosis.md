# Test Hanging Diagnosis Report

**Date:** January 4, 2025
**Status:** CRITICAL - Tests consistently hanging across all test types
**Impact:** Complete test suite unusable, blocking development workflow

## Executive Summary

The Alan Hirsch Digital Platform test suite is experiencing systematic hanging issues across all test types (unit, integration, and e2e tests). This is a critical blocker preventing proper development workflow, CI/CD pipeline functionality, and code quality assurance.

## Test Hanging Patterns Observed

### 1. Unit Tests (Vitest)

- **Command:** `pnpm test` or `pnpm vitest`
- **Behavior:** Hangs indefinitely without output
- **Timeout:** No response after 30+ seconds
- **Process:** Requires manual termination with `pkill -f "pnpm test"`

### 2. Integration Tests

- **Command:** `pnpm vitest run __tests__/api/`
- **Behavior:** Hangs during import resolution phase
- **Error Pattern:** Multiple import resolution failures before hanging
- **Root Cause:** Module resolution issues with `@platform/database/drizzle` and `@/lib/mocks`

### 3. End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

- **Command:** `pnpm playwright test`
- **Behavior:** Hangs during test execution
- **Timeout:** No response after 10+ seconds
- **Process:** Requires manual termination with `pkill -f "playwright"`

## Detailed Analysis

### Import Resolution Failures

The integration tests reveal systematic import resolution issues:

```
Error: Failed to resolve import "@platform/database/drizzle" from "__tests__/api/assessments.test.ts". Does the file exist?
Error: Failed to resolve import "@/lib/mocks" from "__tests__/api/content.test.ts". Does the file exist?
Error: Failed to resolve import "@/app/api/users/route" from "__tests__/api/type-safe-routes.test.ts". Does the file exist?
```

### Module Path Issues

1. **Monorepo Package References:** Tests are trying to import from `@platform/database/drizzle` but the package structure may not be properly configured
2. **Alias Resolution:** `@/lib/mocks` and other `@/` aliases are not resolving correctly in test environment
3. **Missing Files:** Several referenced files don't exist in the expected locations

### Test Configuration Problems

#### Vitest Configuration Issues

- **File:** `vitest.config.ts`
- **Problem:** Alias resolution not working properly for test environment
- **Impact:** Tests can't resolve imports, causing hanging during module loading

#### Playwright Configuration Issues

- **File:** `playwright.config.ts`
- **Problem:** Web server startup may be hanging
- **Impact:** E2E tests can't start because dev server doesn't start properly

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Monorepo Package Resolution

The project uses a monorepo structure with packages (`@platform/database`, `@platform/shared`, etc.) but the test environment isn't properly configured to resolve these package references.

### 2. TypeScript Path Mapping

The `@/` aliases defined in `tsconfig.json` are not being properly resolved in the test environment, causing import failures.

### 3. Missing Dependencies

Several test files reference modules that don't exist or aren't properly exported:

- `@/lib/mocks` - Referenced but may not exist
- `@/app/api/users/route` - API routes may not be built
- `@platform/database/drizzle` - Package may not be properly built

### 4. Build Dependencies

Tests are trying to import from packages that haven't been built, causing resolution failures.

## Impact Assessment

### Development Workflow

- **Blocked:** No way to run tests during development
- **Risk:** Code changes can't be validated
- **Productivity:** Developers can't use TDD or verify functionality

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Blocked:** Automated testing pipeline will fail
- **Risk:** Broken code could be deployed
- **Quality:** No automated quality gates

### Code Quality

- **Coverage:** Test coverage reporting shows 5.71% overall coverage
- **Risk:** Low confidence in code reliability
- **Maintenance:** Technical debt accumulation

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Module Resolution

```bash
# Check if packages are built
pnpm run build

# Verify package exports
ls -la packages/database/dist/
ls -la packages/shared/dist/
```

### 2. Fix Test Configuration

- Update `vitest.config.ts` to properly resolve monorepo packages
- Fix alias resolution for `@/` paths
- Ensure test environment can access built packages

### 3. Create Missing Files

- Create `@/lib/mocks` if it doesn't exist
- Ensure all referenced API routes exist
- Build all packages before running tests

### 4. Test Environment Setup

- Verify test setup files are working
- Check that test dependencies are properly installed
- Ensure database connections work in test environment

## Recommended Solutions

### Short-term (Immediate)

1. **Fix Import Paths:** Update all test files to use correct import paths
2. **Build Packages:** Ensure all packages are built before running tests
3. **Create Missing Files:** Implement missing mock files and utilities
4. **Test Configuration:** Fix vitest and playwright configurations

### Medium-term (This Week)

1. **Monorepo Setup:** Properly configure monorepo package resolution
2. **Test Infrastructure:** Set up proper test database and mocking
3. **CI/CD Integration:** Fix automated test pipeline
4. **Documentation:** Document test setup and running procedures

### Long-term (Next Sprint)

1. **Test Strategy:** Implement comprehensive testing strategy
2. **Coverage Goals:** Increase test coverage to 80%+
3. **Performance:** Optimize test execution time
4. **Monitoring:** Set up test failure monitoring and alerting

## Test Status Summary

| Test Type         | Status     | Coverage | Issues                     |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| Unit Tests        | ❌ Hanging | 5.71%    | Import resolution failures |
| Integration Tests | ❌ Hanging | 0%       | Module path issues         |
| E2E Tests         | ❌ Hanging | N/A      | Web server startup issues  |
| API Tests         | ❌ Failing | 0%       | Missing dependencies       |
| UI Tests          | ❌ Not Run | 0%       | Configuration issues       |

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1:** Fix module resolution in test configuration
2. **Priority 2:** Build all packages and verify exports
3. **Priority 3:** Create missing test utilities and mocks
4. **Priority 4:** Run simple tests to verify fixes
5. **Priority 5:** Gradually enable more complex tests

## Conclusion

The test hanging issue is a critical blocker that requires immediate attention. The root cause is primarily related to module resolution and missing dependencies in the test environment. Once these issues are resolved, the test suite should function properly and provide the necessary quality assurance for the development workflow.

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-4 hours for basic functionality, 1-2 days for full test suite restoration.
